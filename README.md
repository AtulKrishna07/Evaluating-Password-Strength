## Passwords Tested

| Password              | Strength Score | Feedback Summary                              |
|-----------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `atul123`             | Weak (10%)     | Too short, lacks symbols, commonly used       |
| `Atul@123`            | Medium (50%)   | Includes symbol, uppercase, and numbers       |
| `AtuL#983^x`          | Strong (90%)   | High complexity with symbols and case mix     |
| `Monkey!Guitar@Rain9` | Very Strong    | Long passphrase with varied character types   |

## Observations & Best Practices
- Longer passwords are more resistant to brute-force attacks.
- Including symbols, numbers, uppercase, and lowercase characters greatly improves strength.
- Passphrases (4+ unrelated words with symbols/numbers) are both strong and easy to remember.
- Avoid common patterns, names, or personal information.

## Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
Systematically tries every possible combination. Long, complex passwords help defend against this.

### Dictionary Attack
Uses lists of common passwords or phrases. Avoid predictable words and combinations.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrated how simple changes can significantly enhance password strength. Using longer, complex, and unique passwords is essential for improving cybersecurity hygiene and preventing unauthorized access.
